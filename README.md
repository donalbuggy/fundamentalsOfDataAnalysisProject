# fundamentalsOfDataAnalysisProject

This is the repository for my Fundamentals of Data Analysis project. The project involves developing a simple linear regression model for predicting wind turbine power output against wind speed, and testing the accuracy of the model. The assignment consists of the Jupyter notebook contained in this repo. The notebook does not contain any interactive elements or require any action from the reader, beyond simply clicking into the notebook.
